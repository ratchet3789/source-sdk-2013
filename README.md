# Source SDK Doxygen
### What?!
Source SDK lacks documentation. It lacks a FGD generator. It lacks a lot, enough to make it a pain in the ass to develop for if you're not entirely used to the Source Engine Framework. This repo is going to be the slow process of documenting the Source (2013 only) engine to allow newer developers and people not 100% sure of how Source and C++ work to make Source Engine Mods/Standalone Games.

Note: Source Licence still applies, all I am doing is adding a layer to allow ease of use to the engine.
